                    Every moment with you feels like a dream I have that God has fulfilled. Your the way you talk withe me logically lights 
                    up the days I feel like I can't make it, and your laugh is the most beautiful sound I've ever heard. You make the 
                    ordinary extraordinary simply by being in it.

                    I fall in love with you more and more each day, that one thing that will never change. You've 
                    shown me what it means to truly connect with another soul, to be completely vulnerable and yet 
                    completely safe at the same time.

                    better person every single day.
